Time Domain Electromagnetic Field Simulation using the Transmission Line Modelling (TLM) method

Version number: 2.1.0
Date: 8th October 2019

Features:

Frequency dependent material models.

Frequency dependent thin layer models.

Multi-conductor cable model including shielded cable model with frequency dependent 
parameters plus frequency dependent lumped impedance models.

Link to Ngspice for 3D circuit simulation

PML implementation based on:
 J. Odeyemi, A. Vukovic, T. Benson, and P. Sewell, An Improved PML implementation in the transmission line method. IET 10th International Conference on Computational Electromagnetics, 2019.
 
J. Odeyemi, A. Vukovic, T. M. Benson, P. Sewell, A Complex Domain Mappping of the SCN for an Effective PML Implementation in TLM, Submitted for publication, IEEE Trans Antennas and Propagation, 2019.

Outputs suitable for 3D visualisation and animation using paraview.

Sequential and parallel (mpi) implementation

Over 50 example test cases

The code can be compiled under Unix or on windows by compiling and running under cygwin.
See the GGI_TLM/README file for details.

This is a new project and is still undergoing development, testing and documenting.

A work log is kept in GGI_TLM/SOFTWARE_NOTES/work_log.txt

Known problems are noted in GGI_TLM/SOFTWARE_NOTES/known_problems.txt


Please report any issues which you have with the code, test cases or documentation 
and we will do our best to help.
