Version number: 1.2.2
Date: 20th March 2018

Features:

Frequency dependent material models.

Frequency dependent thin layer models.

Multi-conductor cable model including shielded cable model with frequency dependent 
parameters plus frequency dependent lumped impedance models.

Outputs suitable for 3D visualisation and animation using paraview.

Sequential and parallel (mpi) implementation

Over 50 example test cases

The code can be compiled under Unix or on windows by compiling and running under cygwin.
See the GGI_TLM/README file for details.

This is a new project and is still undergoing development, testing and documenting.

A work log is kept in GGI_TLM/SOFTWARE_NOTES/work_log.txt

Known problems are noted in GGI_TLM/SOFTWARE_NOTES/known_problems.txt
