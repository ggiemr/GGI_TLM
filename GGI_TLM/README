Inside GGI_TLM are five main directories
SRC			: containing the source code
DOCUMENTATION		: containing the full user guide, theoretical documentation and test
 		  	  case documentation 
TEST_DATA		: containing the test case directories
ANALYTIC_TEST_DATA	: containing the test case directories for analytic codes 
                          used to produce validation test data
SOFTWARE_NOTES		: containing text files including a work log, known problems and 
		  	  other brief notes relating to the implementation of new input file packets, 
		  	  geometric entities, source functions etc.

Also there are three directories used by the make system

bin			: for executable codes
GGI_TLM_LIBS		: for library files
GGI_TLM_MODULE_FILES 	: for fortran990 module files

In addition to the directories are this README file plus the make_configuration_data and run_configuration_data files.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

SYSTEM CONFIGURATION.

Most directories should be set automatically relative to the GGI_TLM directory. 
The only files which should require editing for a new installation are the 
make_configuration_data file and the run_configuration_data

The make_configuration_data file sets the following:

1. FC			: Name of fortran compiler
2. MPI_INCLUDE		: This is the path to the file mpif.h 
3. FLAGS		: Compilation flags

The run_configuration_data file sets the following:

1. MPI_RUN_COMMAND	: Command for running mpi jobs, 
2. SEQ_RUN_COMMAND	: Command for running seqential codes

Please see the make_configuration_data and run_configuration_data files for an example setup and change as required

Note that it is useful to ensure that the EXECUTABLE_DIR and the current directory (.) is in your path 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

CYGWIN INSTALLATION NOTES

The system will need to be set up as described in the SYSTEM CONFIGURATION note above. 

The path can be set correctly by editing the .bash_profile file to include the line

PATH=".:${HOME}/GGI_TLM/GGI_TLM/bin:${PATH}"

where ${HOME}/GGI_TLM/GGI_TLM/bin should be replaced by the path to the GGI_TLM/bin directory on your system.

MAKING GGI_TLM

The source code is in the SRC directory and should be made from there

GGI_TLM can be made in two configurations, a sequential solver and a parallel solver (mpi). 
The two versions of the solver are made with the commands

make PARALLEL_MODE=SEQ
make PARALLEL_MODE=MPI

make all      will make both sequential and parallel versions

make          will re-make the most recent make type (seq or mpi)

make clean    will clean the object files and module files

make clean_all will clean the object files and module files plus the executables

RUNNING GGI_TLM

THE GGI_TLM system consists of 9 codes which are used to create models, visualise 
and check geometry, meshes and cable models, create frequency dependent material 
models from measured data, run and then post-process results.

GGI_TLM consists of the following codes:	

GGI_TLM_model_builder

GGI_TLM_model_checks

GGI_TLM_cable_model_builder

GGI_TLM_cable_model_checks

GGI_TLM_filter_fit

GGI_TLM_filter_format_convert

GGI_TLM_material_model_checks

GGI_TLM_SEQ/ GGI_TLM_MPI

GGI_TLM_post_process. 

All the codes with the exception of the main solver GGI_TLM_MPI are sequential and are 
run by simply typing the name of the code. The GGI_TLM_MPI solver code may be run on a
single process in the same way however for a parallel run we require a command of the 
form 

mpirun.mpich2 -np  x   GGI_TLM_MPI

where x is the number of processors to run the solution on (this may be different depending on how you run with mpi)

Note that this must be specified in the file TEST_DATA/run_automatic_test_include in 
order to run the test cases.  The process of setting up and running the test cases 
is described in an accompanying document. 

Running  a GGI_TLM model requires an input file which specifies the geometry, materials,
cables, boundary conditions, excitation and outputs required for a problem. The input 
file should have the extension .inp. The construction of the input file is described 
in detail in the subsequent sections. The model may also require files which describe  material and cable properties.

Each code prompts the user for the name of the input file. The name without the .inp extension should be provided i.e. if we have a file NAME.inp then enter NAME only
All output files have the format NAME.output_extension. The file extensions for the 
different types of output are summarised in a subsequent section.

Running a model proceeds in a number of stages, firstly a 3D meshed model is created from 
the input file using the code GGI_TLM_model_builder. This creates a mesh from the geometry description. The model may be examined and checked by using the code GGI_TLM_model_checks 
which produces files for 3D visualisation of the model and mesh with Paraview.

If the problem includes cables then the code GGI_TLM_cable_model_builder creates a cable 
model. The cable model may be checked using the code GGI_TLM_cable_model_checks.

GGI_TLM_filter_fit generates frequency dependent material models from measured material 
parameter

GGI_TLM_filter_format_convert allows the conversion of the material filter formats between r
ational functions, pole-zero format and pole-residue format. This is only used if the 
material models are to be used in other codes which use a different filter format 
definition - it is not required to run GGI_TLM. 

GGI_TLM_material_model_checks allows the visualisation of material model frequency 
responses as well as producing files for visualisation of the allocation of materials onto the computational mesh.

Once the mesh and the cable model have been built then GGI_TLM is run with the command

mpirun.mpich2 -np x GGI_TLM_MPI

where x is the number of processors to run the solution on (or something similar...)

or 

GGI_TLM_SEQ

for the sequenctial version

A general information file with extension .info is always produced. Any warnings are 
written to a .warnings file and if there are cables in the problem specification then a 
.cable_info file is produced which contains details of the cable aspects of the model.

Once the model has been run, the results may be post processed using GGI_TLM_post_process. 
There are a large number of post processing options depending on the type of analysis and 
the particular output produced. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

An executable file has been provided which cleans all the files which are not required in the repository (object files, executable files, all files related to the running of test cases), it also updates the version information in the README.md file.
The cleaning is achieved with the command:

clean_before_repository_update
