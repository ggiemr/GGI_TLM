Terminology:
origin is the remote repository that you cloned from
master is the cloned repository that you have locally

To clone an existing repository:

git clone git@128.243.70.77:UoN/ESA_SPICE_CABLE_MODELLING.git

Creating a tag:
git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"

to view all tags:
git tag

to push tags to the remote server:
git push origin --tags


to create a new branch:
git branch testing

to move to the new branch:
git checkout testing

(The two commands above can be combined with:
git checkout -b testing
)

To push this branch to a remote repository:
git push -u origin testing

to move back to the original branch:
git checkout master

(Note that you should have committed changes in the old branch before
going back to the master)

to look at the branch structure and which branch you are working on:
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
(the branch labeled HEAD is the current branch)

alternatively 
git branch
gives the existing branches and markes the current branch with *

from the master branch we may merge any changes with
git merge testing

once merged the branch can be deleted with
git branch -d testing

If merging finds a conflict then this will have to be resolved before 
the merge can be completed.
The command
git status 
shows the files with unresolved conflicts at any point. 

within the file there is a section where both versions of the unmerged 
file are displayed - this must be resolved by editing the file

once the conflict has been resolved then use
git add file
to indicate that theerge has been completed.

see merged branches with
git branch --merged

and unmerged branches with 
git branch --no-merged

to get remote changes (without merging them)
git fetch

then merge with
git merge

Alternatively the command
git pull
does both these operations

The commmand
git rebase
'flattens' the merged structure so that changes to one branch are added after
 the changes to the other branch rather than the 'parallel' changes of merge.
NOTE: Do not rebase commits that exist outside your repository.
The effect of rebase is to provide a cleaner history of the developments.
