! NAME
!     GGI_TLM_model_builder
!
! DESCRIPTION
!     Builds the geometry based on tetrahedral volumes, triangulated surfaces, line segments and points
!     These unstructured geometric objects are then meshed using a uniform cubic mesh.
!
!     Meshed volumes are cell based, Meshed surfaces are face based, 
!     line segments are based on cell centre to cell face centre line segments (this
!     reflects the TLM cable model algorithm) and points are cell centre based.
!
!     The model builder outputs the unstructured geometry representation to vtk format files
!     suitable for visualisation with ParaView
!
