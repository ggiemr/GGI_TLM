SETTING UP THE MAKEFILE

The Makefile uses the file ../make_configuration_data in order to set things up for a particular system

The following three definitions in the ../make_configuration_data file may have to be changed:

# Name of fortran compiler. Try to use one that automatically links mpi eg mpif90.
FC=mpif90.mpich2 

# MPI_INCLUDE :This is the path to the file mpif.h 
MPI_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/mpich2

# compilation flags. Here we compile with bounds check
FLAGS= -D$(MODE) -cpp -fbounds-check -finit-real=nan -finit-integer=nan -J$(MOD_DIR) -I$(MOD_DIR) -I$(MPI_INCLUDE) 

USING THE MAKEFILE

The makefile will make either a sequential or parallel (mpi) version of the code.

To make the parallel version:

make PARALLEL_MODE=MPI

To make the sequential version:

make PARALLEL_MODE=SEQ

The default (if you just use 'make') is to re-make the most recently made version or the SEQ version
if the system has been cleaned.

make clean : cleans everything except executables

make clean_all : cleans everything including executables

IMPORTANT NOTE: you must 'make clean' before switching from making MPI to SEQ or vice-versa (but not make clean_all)
